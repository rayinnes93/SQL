#1  How many orders were placed in January?

select count(*) from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderID)=6
and orderID <> 'Order ID' ;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

select count(*) from BIT_DB.JanSales 
where Product = 'iPhone'
and length(orderID)=6
and orderID <> 'Order ID';


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 


select distinct acctnum
from BIT_DB.customers cust
inner join BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
where length(orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

select distinct Product, price
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where price in(Select min(price)from BIT_DB.JanSales);


#Alternative solution:

select distinct Product, price
from BIT_DB.JanSales
order by price asc limit 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

select sum (quantity)*price as revenue, product from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

select sum(Quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location ='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by product;


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

select count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
from BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
left join BIT_DB.customers cust
on Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
where Feb.Quantity>2
and length(orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

select distinct Product, sum(Quantity) as TotalSold
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where Location like '%Los Angeles%' 
group by Product;
